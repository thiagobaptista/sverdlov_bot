This is a small Ruby script I've created in order to search for tweets mentioning a specific fake profile and to send a message to those who written it warning about the "fakeness" of that profile.

This script uses Ruby 1.9.2 and the Twitter Gem, and can be used as an example of how to create a "listener" twitter bot.
